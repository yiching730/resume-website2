            ⭐️Hi! I'm Yiching Jiang, but you can call me Yiching. I reside in Taichung, Taiwan, which is also my hometown. Taichung is a vibrant and lively city, known for its youthful energy. One of its highlights is the abundance of delicious and meticulously crafted local cuisine. <br>
            <br>
            ⭐️In my home, I have my parents and a brother whom I cherish dearly. Spending time with my family is something I value a lot. Occasionally, I embark on weekend trips with my close friends. These journeys are not only enjoyable but also offer breathtaking scenery that allows me to unwind. I appreciate the beauty of the landscapes during these travels, providing a sense of relaxation. <br>
            <br>
            ⭐️My upbringing instilled in me values of politeness and responsibility, turning me into an independent individual. One of my passions is Looking at interesting jokes or stickers in the community(FB) and indulging in music. I find joy in music that contribute to the stress reduction of both my body and spirit. I also find solace in soft and comforting music, which can significantly uplift my mood. The research suggests not to expose oneself to negative news for more than 30 minutes a day. Regularly indulging in jokes helps me maintain a positive mindset and thinking. <br>
            <br>
            ⭐️I did not graduate with a degree in Computer Science and Information Engineering. Later on, I developed an interest in pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science and Information Engineering. Although I didn't complete the degree, my previous work involved learning the C#(.net core MVC) programming language, mainly focusing on utilizing the built-in MVC for convenient frontend and backend development. I also pushed projects to Docker for deployment. Currently, I rely on ChatGPT for some queries, and in the past, I would seek assistance on websites like Stack Overflow. The field of programming is continually evolving, and I regularly enhance my skills through platforms like Udemy.<br>

            ⭐️Thank you. <br>
